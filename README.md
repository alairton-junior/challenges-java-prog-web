## Java Programming Exercises I

This document contains a list of Java programming exercises, grouped by topic: sequential structure, decision structure, repetition structure, and strings & arrays.

## Sequential Structure

1. Create a Java program that displays the message: **"Hello, world!"** on the screen.
2. Create a Java program that asks for a number via keyboard input and then displays the message: **"The number entered was [number]."**
3. Create a Java program that receives 3 grades via keyboard input, calculates, and displays the arithmetic mean on the console.
4. Create a Java program that receives a number in meters via keyboard input, converts it to centimeters, and displays the result.
5. Create a Java program that calculates and displays the area of a circle on the console. Use the formula: **A = πr²**.

## Decision Structure

6. Create a Java program that asks for the price of three products via keyboard input and informs which one to buy, assuming the decision is always based on the cheapest option.
7. Create a Java program that receives **N** grades via keyboard input, calculates and displays the arithmetic mean. Also, inform whether the student passed (mean ≥ 7) or failed.
8. Create a Java program to calculate a student’s final average (FA) between two grades. Display the student’s status based on the following:
    - Approved if **FA ≥ 7**
    - If **FA ≥ 4 and < 7**, the student takes an extra exam (AF).
        - Approved if **AF ≥ 4** and **(FA + AF) / 2 ≥ 5**
        - Otherwise, failed.
    - If AF is needed, ask for the grade and show the final result with or without AF.
9. Create a Java program that receives three numbers via keyboard input and displays the largest one.
10. Create a Java program that receives an integer via keyboard input and displays whether it is even or odd.

## Repetition Structure

11. Create a Java program that displays the multiplication table of an integer from 0 to 10. Use a `for` loop and allow only valid numbers (0 to 10).
12. Create a Java program that asks for a grade from 0 to 10. If the input is invalid, display a message and keep asking until a valid grade is entered.
13. In an election with three candidates, create a Java program that asks for the total number of voters. Each voter casts a vote via keyboard. At the end, show the number of votes each candidate received.
14. Create a Java program that receives 10 integers greater than 1 and checks if each number is prime. Display a message indicating whether each number is prime or not.
15. Create a Java program that displays the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence: **0-1-1-2-3-5-8-13-21-34**
16. Create a Java program that reads a positive integer and calculates its factorial. Display the result.

## Strings and Arrays

17. Create a Java program that fills an array with 5 integers via keyboard input and displays them.
18. Create a Java program that fills an array with 10 real numbers via keyboard input and displays them in reverse order.
19. Create a Java program that fills an array with 5 integers, and then displays the sum, the product, and the numbers themselves.
20. Create a Java program that receives 20 integers via keyboard input and stores them in an array. Store the even numbers in a "even" array and the odd numbers in an "odd" array. Display all three arrays.
21. Create a Java program that receives 2 Strings via keyboard input and displays their content and length. Also, check and display if the strings are equal in length and/or content.
22. **Number Reversal**: Create a Java program that shows the reverse of an integer entered via keyboard. Example: **127 -> 721**.
23. **Basic Calculator**: Create a Java program that receives two numbers and an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and displays the result.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
